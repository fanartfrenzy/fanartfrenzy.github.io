<h2>Our stance on AI</h2>
<p>
    AI is not accepted in any form for Fanart Frenzy.</p>
<p>Fanart Frenzy was created to combat scammers that were targeting fanfic writers, many of whom use AI as part of their
    scam. Being anti-AI is baked into this event at its core. AI is theft and we find the use of it to be disrespectful
    to the many wonderful artists and writers that have signed up to participate in this event and support each other
    through their creations.
</p>
<p>We firmly believe that anything you, a human, can create is better than whatever an AI can put out. Your work is
    valuable because you created it, perceived flaws and all. You don't have to be good at something to create for this
    event- it's only going to be meaningful if you create.
</p>
<p>We promise that your fellow writers, any writers, will be thrilled to receive any product made by your hand. Even if
    you think it’s bad or messy or imperfect. It’s real, and it’s human.
    To sum up, AI is not welcome in this event.
