    <p>Here&rsquo;s a quick guide on what to include in your posts! This will vary slightly by platform. Post anywhere
        you&rsquo;d normally post - these are just guidelines for the socials we use and are aware of. If you&rsquo;re
        only able to post on one platform (ex. if you&rsquo;ve made a tumblr-style gifset), please feel free to link it
        on our other socials as well! Please include all elements in your posts, but beyond that, design and structure
        your posts however you like.</p>

    <h4 id="tumblrsection"><strong>Tumblr:</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>Elements to include in your post:</strong></p>
    
    <p>1. The art!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Instructions and tips for posting can be found here:&nbsp;<a
                href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/image-gif-troubleshooting/">images</a>,&nbsp;<a
                href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/posting-video/">videos</a>,&nbsp;<a
                href="https://help.tumblr.com/knowledge-base/audio/">audio</a>. If your art can&rsquo;t be shared by any
            of these methods, send us a message and we&rsquo;ll help you sort it out.</li>
        <li>- For longer videos, we recommend posting on youtube, vimeo, or another video hosting site and posting as a
            link/embedding.</li>
        <li>- For audio such as music or podfics, we recommend posting on an audio hosting platform and posting as a
            link/embedding.</li>
        <li>- If your art can&rsquo;t be shared by any of these methods, or if you&rsquo;re having trouble posting,
            please send us a message and we&rsquo;ll help you sort it out!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>2. Image/Video description</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Alt-text for any images, video, or audio included in your post. This makes it easier for people using
            screen readers to enjoy your art.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>3. Credit the Author</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- A link to the fic that inspired your work as well as the fic&rsquo;s title, author, tags, and summary.</li>
        <li>- Optional: If you like, share a little about the fic, why you enjoyed it, what inspired you, etc. to
            recommend it to others.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>4. Warnings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- If any archive warnings apply to the fic or your art, please mention that in your post in clear terms.</li>
        <li>- Do not use euphemisms or alternative terms (ex. grape) or censor words (ex. r*pe). Using the exact terms
            helps people using tumblr&rsquo;s content blocking mechanism avoid content they don&rsquo;t wish to see.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>5. Tagging</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- If the author is on tumblr, tag them by adding @ username, or use their hashtag. If not, please share the
            post with them via link.</li>
        <li>- Tag us! @FanartFrenzy and use the hashtags #fanart frenzy or #fanartfrenzy</li>
        <li>- Note which bingo square you&rsquo;re filling in. If you&rsquo;d like to include your bingo card in the
            post, instructions for including additional images here, and for placing it behind a cut here.</li>
    </ul>

At the top is a digital art piece showing a terrified walrus with a monocle reacting to a dead walrus and abandoned feather duster on an ice floe. The post reads: Here&rsquo;s the next piece for my @fanartfrenzy bingo card, filling the prompt, &ldquo;make art for a fic you&rsquo;ve reread more than once.&rdquo; I had to pick Clue Rewritten to be About Walruses by [@/author] for this one. I&rsquo;ve read it more times than I can count, and every single time I find something new to love about it. The way they use the walrus theme to recreate the movie&rsquo;s alternate endings but this time highlighting different impacts of climate change on sea life is both poignant and incredibly innovative. I picked my favorite scene to illustrate, where Colonel Mustard finds the walrus maid dead on the ice floe, with her flipper still clutching the feather duster she inexplicably has in the arctic. The descriptions of his shock and terror are so striking! The way [author] writes it, I feel like I&rsquo;m right there in the scene with Walrus Colonel Mustard, freezing my butt off and wondering who could have committed this grisly walrus crime, and how a walrus was ever promoted to the rank of Colonel. (They do explain that last bit, and it&rsquo;s incredible.) Definitely check this one out and give [author] some love! Title: Clue Rewritten to be About Walruses - [add the link to the title or post the link underneath the information]. Author: Username. Fandom: Clue (1985). Ship(s): Miss Scarlet/The Singing Telegram Girl. Summary: One dark, stormy night in the arctic, at a gathering of walruses with the darkest secrets it&rsquo;s possible for a walrus to have, tragedy strikes repeatedly. As the walruses are picked off one by one, they must determine which of them is the killer, why they were summoned to the ice floe and by whom, and how walruses even have a conservatory.

    <h4 id="ao3section"><strong>Archive of Our Own:</strong></h4>
    <p><strong>Elements to include in your post:</strong></p>
    <p>1. The art!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Ao3 does not natively host image, audio, or video content</li>
        <li>- We recommend posting on an appropriate platform and embedding on Ao3. Instructions on how to do that can
            be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/2425535">Images</a>,&nbsp;<a
                href="https://www.tumblr.com/fanartfrenzy/799947152798433280/uploading-audio-and-video-to-ao3?source=share">Audio/Video</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>2. Image/Video description</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Please include a description of any image, video, or audio</li>
        <li>- You can add alt text to an image embed by adding alt text to your image embed code like so:</li>
        <li>- </li>
        <li>- This is not an option for video embeds. Consider including a video description in the author&rsquo;s note
            instead&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>3. Give it a title</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Ao3 does require a work title, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be anything fancy! A common titling method is
            something like &ldquo;[Art/Moodboard/Playlist/Etc] for [Inspiration Fic]&rdquo;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>4. Tags</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Ao3 requires that you select a Fandom, Language, Rating, and Archive Warning</li>
        <li>- Consider tagging your art with its medium (fanart, playlist, moodboard, tradional/digital art, fanvid,
            etc) as well as any other relevant tags</li>
    </ul>
    <p>5. Add your art to our Ao3 collection!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Option 1: Go to the collection page and select &ldquo;Post to Collection&rdquo;. This will auto-fill the
            collection information in the appropriate box</li>
        <li>- Option 2: Fill in the collection information yourself by typing Fanart Frenzy 2026 in the &ldquo;Post to
            Collections/Challenges&rdquo; box (at the top of the Associations section) and select our collection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>6. Use the inspired by function</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- In the Associations section, there is a checkbox saying &ldquo;This work is a remix, a translation, a
            podfic, or was inspired by another work&rdquo;. Check it and fill in the details for connecting your art to
            its inspiring fic</li>
        <li>- For works hosted on Ao3, all you need it the work URL and Ao3 will auto-fill the details for you</li>
        <li>- For works hosted elsewhere, you must fill out the URL, title, and author attribution yourself</li>
        <li>- This function means your art will link back to the inspiration fic in the notes section of your art, and
            if the author approves the link on their end, their fic will link to your art!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>7. Gift your art</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Please consider using the gift function if the author is on Ao3. Simply type their pseud into the
            &ldquo;Gift this work to&rdquo; box in the Associations section and select them.</li>
        <li>- This results in the &ldquo;[Work] by [You] for [Author]&rdquo; style work title you may have seen in
            search results</li>
        <li>- Some authors have set their preferences to not receive gifts, in which case Ao3 will give you an error
            message telling you this when you go to post. You&rsquo;ll have to remove the gift attribution in this case
        </li>
