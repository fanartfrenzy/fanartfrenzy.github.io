<h2>Event Rules</h2>

<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 1:</strong> Be kind! No bigotry, no bashing, no harassment.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<ul class="RihjV">
<li class="k31gt">- We will not allow any form of bigotry - transphobia, homophobia, racism and so on. Be kind and please don&rsquo;t engage with anyone doing otherwise - just report and block.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- You may come across fandoms, ships, and content you don&rsquo;t like/agree with. Please be respectful of others&rsquo; likes/dislikes.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- Do not criticize/critique linked fics. Authors will likely see content related to their works. Comment and interact with this assumption in mind. If they have asked for constructive criticism, please only provide that in the place where they requested it.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- Do not doxx, attack, or troll other participants.</li>
</ul>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 2:</strong> All art posts must include a link to the associated fic. Please check our posting guidelines for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 3:</strong> You must leave a comment with your art embedded, linked, or with directions to find it on the fic that inspired it. See our commenting guide for details and exceptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 4:</strong> If you are creating podfic for this event, please attain author approval before recording. This is required in order to post your podfic on Ao3 according to their terms of service. (The &lsquo;podfic welcome&rsquo; tag on AO3 is a great place to find fics for this purpose if you&rsquo;re shy.)</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 5: </strong>No AI or AI-assisted art - This event exists to counteract scammers and AI. Its use is antithetical to our goals and it is not welcome here.</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 6:</strong> No discussions of commissions or exchanging money for fanwork in any way.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<ul class="RihjV">
<li class="k31gt">- This event exists to counteract scammers who solicit money from fanfiction writers. Please do not ask for or offer any kind of money in exchange for art or fic here.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- Do not link to or advertise any kind of paid service or product in official event spaces. If you are selling art created for this event as prints or other products, please keep all information related to it on your own blogs, websites, or in other spaces you would typically advertise.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- If anyone requests money from you in exchange for fanwork, please report it right away and do not engage.</li>
</ul>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 7: </strong>Content restrictions</p>
</div>
<ul class="RihjV">
<li class="k31gt">- You can make whatever art you like for whatever fic you like.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- To keep our tumblr visible to participants of all ages, we won&rsquo;t be reblogging any NSFW art to our blog, but you are absolutely allowed to create it for this event. Please feel free share it on our subreddit, on AO3, and/or in the tumblr/bluesky tags, but be mindful of platform rules and keep NSFW content and common triggers clearly tagged.</li>
<li class="k31gt">- Anything posted on our platforms (our discord server, the ao3 collection, or the subreddit) is subject to Rule 1.</li>
</ul>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 8:</strong> Tag spoilers! Please be mindful of posting art or fic that might spoil recently-released media. If your art contains spoilers for any media released within three months of posting, please use spoiler tags and mark it accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 9: </strong>The vast majority of authors will be thrilled to receive art inspired by their fics, but everyone is different and while we anticipate this being extremely rare, a situation may arise where an author requests that you take down your art and/or remove the link back to their fic. In these cases, please comply with the author&rsquo;s wishes, and if you&rsquo;d like, post the art again entirely divorced from their fic. If you need help resolving this kind of situation, please send us a message and we&rsquo;ll do what we can to sort it out. We recommend checking if authors have anything on their AO3 profiles explicitly forbidding fanart of their work before starting your projects, but this is likely to be exceptionally rare.</p>
</div>
<div class="k31gt">
<p><strong>Rule 10:</strong> While you are free to post on X/Twitter, please refrain from posting links to that platform on our subreddit or on our discord. If you would like your art here or on our other socials, please create a new post rather than linking from Twitter.</p>
