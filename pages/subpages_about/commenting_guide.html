    <h4><strong>ARTISTS</strong></h4>
    <p>Because of the scam going around, authors will likely be rightfully jumpy about mentions of art and links in
        comments. We&rsquo;re hoping to get around that by presenting the art straight away without any mention of
        chatting more, a sketchy lure to a second location, or any of the usual hallmarks of the scam. You can read more
        about the scam on AO3&nbsp;<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/33026">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>When making your comment, it&rsquo;s important to make it clear to the author that you&rsquo;re&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A real fan who actually read and enjoyed their work - you can do this by mentioning specifics, character
            names, and events from the fic.</li>
        <li>An actual artist, who has already produced work and is sharing it without any further interaction from the
            author - you can do this by embedding your work directly into the comment (more on that below) or linking to
            a recognizable site (your post on reddit, tumblr, or bluesky, vs a random site a bot might use.).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>What to include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- &nbsp;Embed, link, or include instructions to find your art piece.</li>
        <li>- Ex. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pic of the yarn art I made of your character design!&rdquo; [<strong>EMBEDDED
                IMAGE</strong>]</li>
        <li>- Ex. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a link to the score I composed for this fic, I hope you like it!&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ%E2%80%9D">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&rdquo;</a>
        </li>
        <li>- Be sure to write out links rather than embedding in text&nbsp;<a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">like this</a>&nbsp;so they can see exactly where it
            leads and that it&rsquo;s a recognizable website.</li>
        <li>- Ex. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to make you click on a sketchy link - you can find it on my tumblr, same
            username, I tagged the piece with your username and fic title!&rdquo;</li>
        <li>- Something nice about the fic/why you chose it - or anything else you&rsquo;d normally say in a comment</li>
        <li>- Mention or link to Fanart Frenzy so that they&rsquo;re aware that this is a sanctioned event coming from
            within fandom, not a random bot or scam network.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What to avoid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Vague references to the fic that could be about any fic on the internet (ex. The characters had so much
            depth! It really blew me away!)</li>
        <li>- These are fine when combined with specifics within a genuine comment, but isolated, they&rsquo;re a clear
            sign of bot/scammer activity.</li>
        <li>- Requests for the author to meet you in a second location (discord, email, tumblr, etc.)</li>
        <li>- Requests for personal information</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Example comment:</strong></p>
    <blockquote class="example_comment">
    <p>&ldquo;Oh my god, dude, I absolutely love this fic. The way you swapped all the characters for walruses so
        seamlessly just kills me every time. THE TALENT!!! And the subtle allusions to climate change throughout before
        revealing it as the real killer in the final alternate ending? Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;m doing the Fanart Frenzy event this month, and I just had to pick this fic for one of the prompts.
        Here&rsquo;s the painting I did of the scene where Colonel Mustard finds the maid. [<strong>EMBEDDED
            IMAGE</strong>]. I absolutely love the way you wrote this scene. Every time I read it, I kind of forget
        I&rsquo;m reading a fanfic about Clue if the entire cast was walruses because you make his terror seem so real
        and visceral as he realizes what he&rsquo;s seeing. I really hope you like my version of it! I also posted this
        on my tumblr (same username) if you want to see the post there. Thank you so much for writing this and bringing
        Clue Walruses into the world, I had no idea I needed it until I read this!&rdquo;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(Obviously you don&rsquo;t need to go on and on about their walrus writing skills if that&rsquo;s not your style,
        this is just an example.)</p>
    <p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>
    <p>There may be cases where you are unable to comment, such as when an author has turned comments off entirely. In
        this case, we&rsquo;d advise you not to choose that work, as for one reason or another, they&rsquo;re not
        looking to interact with their readers. But if the change is made once you&rsquo;ve already completed your
        piece, you can still post it elsewhere, tag it properly, and hope that they see and enjoy it.</p>
    <p>If any other strange case arises, or you&rsquo;d like some additional guidance on commenting, please contact us
        on any of our other socials, and we&rsquo;ll do our best to help you sort it out.</p>
    <p><strong>Embedding images:</strong></p>
    <p>Embedding images in comments on AO3 is currently still allowed, though this feature is occasionally switched off
        to prevent spam. You will need to host your image elsewhere - art sites such as&nbsp;<a target="_blank" 
            href="https://sheezy.art/">Sheezyart</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a target="_blank"  href="https://artfol.app/">Artfol</a>&nbsp;are good
        options, as well as general file hosting sites like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.dropbox.com/">dropbox&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a target="_blank"  href="https://catbox.moe/">catbox</a>.</p>
    <p>Once you have your image uploaded, grab its unique URL and enter it into this html:&nbsp;<strong>&lt;img
            src=&ldquo;image URL&rdquo; /&gt;</strong></p>
    <p>Paste the url between the quote marks and remove the space between &ldquo; and /. Your image should appear in
        your comment once posted.</p>
