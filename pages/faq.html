            <p>
                You can sign up via our entry form! In late December, we'll send out bingo cards to each participant
                with prompts guiding you towards fics in your fandom to make art for. (Ex. Make art for a fic with no
                comments). Throughout January, you can make as few or as many pieces of art as you like - you can aim
                for a bingo, a blackout, or even just pick one fic you really want to make art for. Post your work
                anywhere you'd normally post it, then share with the writer and the Fanart Frenzy community here or on
                discord, tumblr, bluesky, and AO3.

        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>Literally anything artistic. You can make traditional art or digital art, you can compose music or curate
                a playlist, you can make a gif set or memes about the fic. Everything from oil paintings to shoe box
                dioramas is welcome here. Feel free to message us if you’re not sure, but generally speaking, if it’s
                something that you were inspired to make by a fic, it’s perfect for the event and we want to see it.</p>

        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>
            <p>See above! You don’t need to know how to draw. We’ll take any kind of art you want to create. That said,
                if you don’t enjoy making art, you can still participate as a commenter! Sign up via the same entry form
                - just tick the ‘comment prompts’ box for your bingo card, and we’ll send you a card with prompts to
                help you find fics in your fandom to comment on during the event period.</p>
            <p>If you don’t really want to do that, but you still want to help make the event a success, you can join us
                as a promoter! We’re looking for people in all fandoms to help spread the word during the sign-up
                period. More info on that <a

                Just fill out the entry form and if we have an opening in your fandom,
                we’ll get in touch!</p>

            Can I do writing/poetry/fanfic of a fanfic/etc. for this event?
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
            <p>We’re keeping our focus on making fanart for fanfic this round, so fanfic and other writing-based mediums
                are generally not what we’re looking for. Poetry, if it has a significant visual/audio element (written
                out with calligraphy, embroidered, spoken word, or something like concrete poetry) that is of equal or
                greater focus, is just fine! Something like blackout poetry or text-only poetry is a bit too far from
                visual arts for this event, as the focus is mainly on the words rather than any visual element.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, scammers are currently flooding fanfiction comments offering art commissions in exchange

                threads in the subreddit and a fic recommendation channel in the discord server where everyone can
                recommend fics. It might also be an opportunity to branch out into some new fandoms! We’ll make sure you

            <p>In our experience, this is likely to be a very, very rare occurrence. Every time this question has been
                asked in fanfiction discussion spaces such as r/AO3 or r/fanfiction, the response from authors is almost
                universally that they’d lose their minds with joy at any art, no matter the form or skill level.</p>
            <p>If this does happen and an author asks you to take down your work or remove the link to their work, we’re
                really sorry, but please do comply with their wishes. If you need assistance with any interaction like
                this, contact us and we’ll do our best to help you out.</p>

If you’re worried about notifying someone you don’t know well multiple times, you can refrain from tagging them in your post or interrupt the tag (adding punctuation after the at sign, before their username - ex. @.fanartfrenzy) so people can still check out their blog.<br><br>It’s very easy to miss a tagged post on tumblr, and if you comment on their work, the author is much more likely to see it.
