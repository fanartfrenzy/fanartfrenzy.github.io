      How does the event work?

      <span>
        You can sign up via our entry form! In late December, we'll send out bingo cards to each participant with prompts guiding you towards fics in your fandom to make art for. (Ex. Make art for a fic with no comments). Throughout January, you can make as few or as many pieces of art as you like - you can aim for a bingo, a blackout, or even just pick one fic you really want to make art for. Post your work anywhere you'd normally post it, then share with the writer and the Fanart Frenzy community here or on discord, tumblr, bluesky, and AO3.

      What kind of art do you allow?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>Literally anything artistic. You can make traditional art or digital art, you can compose music or curate a playlist, you can make a gif set or memes about the fic. Everything from oil paintings to shoe box dioramas is welcome here. Feel free to comment your medium below or message us if you’re not sure, but generally speaking, if it’s something that you were inspired to make by a fic, it’s perfect for the event and we want to see it.</span>

      I like this idea, but I can’t draw.
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>
        <p>See above! You don’t need to know how to draw. We’ll take any kind of art you want to create. That said, if you don’t enjoy making art, you can still participate as a commenter! Sign up via the same entry form - just tick the ‘comment prompts’ box for your bingo card, and we’ll send you a card with prompts to help you find fics in your fandom to comment on during the event period.</p>
        <p>If you don’t really want to do that, but you still want to help make the event a success, you can join us as a promoter! We’re looking for people in all fandoms to help spread the word during the sign-up period. More info on that here. Just fill out the entry form and if we have an opening in your fandom, we’ll get in touch!</p>
        <p>And if you don’t want to do that, you can still help out by sharing our posts and spreading the word!</p>

      Can I do writing/poetry/fanfic of a fanfic/etc. for this event?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>We’re keeping our focus on making fanart for fanfic this round, so fanfic and other writing-based mediums are generally not what we’re looking for. Poetry, if it has a significant visual/audio element (written out with calligraphy, embroidered, spoken word, or something like concrete poetry) that is of equal or greater focus, is just fine! Something like blackout poetry or text-only poetry is a bit too far from visual arts for this event, as the focus is mainly on the words rather than any visual element.</span>

      <span>
        <p>Just sign up now, problem solved! Just kidding - if you’re still waffling and the deadline passes you by, or you didn’t hear about the event until Jan 5th, contact us and we’ll work something out.</p>
        <p>We’ll also have weekly mini challenges, so even if you’re not sold on formally participating, we’ll have some lower-commitment stuff for you to do!</p>

    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>We’re holding the event in January. You’ll have your bingo cards before then, so feel free to start scoping out fics as soon as you get it. The AO3 collection will be open for posting from January 1st until January 31st, 2026.</span>

    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>Please still finish it up and post it! While there is an official event period, we’ll still be boosting people’s works on our socials after it ends and we hope to do mini challenges in between events. It’s just a fun challenge, not a homework assignment, and there’s no penalty for being late.</span>

    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>
        <p>Hopefully that won’t happen, but we’re taking as many precautions as we can to ensure that everyone shares their art in a clear, non-scammy way. Please check out our commenting guide before commenting with your art!</p>
        <p>You can also share your art with authors via AO3’s gifting feature if the author has the option turned on.</p>

      What if I can’t find a fic that fits the prompt in my fandom?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>The prompts are fairly simple (make art for a fic you’ve reread, make art for a fic with 10k or more words, etc.) so there should be something to suit each prompt, but we’ll have weekly recommendation threads in the subreddit and a fic recommendation channel in the discord server where everyone can recommend fics. It might also be an opportunity to branch out into some new fandoms! We’ll make sure you find something fun that inspires you.</span>

      Do I have to get permission from the authors before I make my art?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>Only if you’re recording a podfic. In all other circumstances, we’re trying to avoid looking like scammers - who also promise art at some point in the nebulous future - so we ask that you only approach authors about/with your work once it’s complete and you can show it to them immediately.</span>

      What if they don’t want it/get mad at me?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>
        <p>In our experience, this is likely to be a very, very rare occurrence. Every time this question has been asked in fanfiction discussion spaces such as r/AO3 or r/fanfiction, the response from authors is almost universally that they’d lose their minds with joy at any art, no matter the form or skill level.</p>
        <p>If this does happen and an author asks you to take down your work or remove the link to their work, we’re really sorry, but please do comply with their wishes. If you need assistance with any interaction like this, contact us and we’ll do our best to help you out.</p>
        <p>But generally speaking, fanart hater georg is an outlier adn should not have been counted.</p>

      Can I participate if I don’t have a [discord, reddit, tumblr, AO3], etc.?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>Of course! As long as you have a way to post your art and get it to the author, you can participate. Involvement on any one platform isn’t a requirement.</span>

    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>Absolutely! Your fic options will be limited to those available to guests, and we won’t be able to add your work to the AO3 collection, but as long as you have a place to post your art and a way to get it to the author, you’re good to go.</span>

      Why can’t we post twitter/X links on the subreddit or discord server?
    </div>
    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <span>The official position of this event and its organizers is fuck That Guy with a cactus. You’re welcome to post your art on Twitter/X if you normally would, but if you’re sharing your art in official event spaces like the discord server or reddit, please make a new post on that platform rather than sharing a twitter link.</span>
