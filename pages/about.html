    <p>As you may unfortunately be aware, scammers are currently flooding fanfiction comments with art commission scams (more info on the scam and what to look out for <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/33026" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>). And we&apos;re absolutely sick of it. So here&apos;s our solution! Fanart Frenzy - an event designed to counteract these scammers and their impact on the fanfiction community, as well as raise awareness of their evolving scams.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>What is Fanart Frenzy?</h4>
</div>
<div>
    <p>Fanart Frenzy is a month-long bingo event designed to bring a wave of fanfiction-inspired fanart into the community, entirely free and unsolicited, as fandom is supposed to be, in order to stem the flow of these scammers, encourage our favorite fic writers, and liven up our fandoms. This event is anti-AI - real, human-made art only! Our first event will take place from January 1-31, 2026.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
</div>
<div>
    <p>You can sign up via our <a href="https://forms.gle/4oqe71AjBgiD5g137" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sign up form</a>! In late December, we&apos;ll send out bingo cards to each participant with prompts guiding you towards fics in your fandom to make art for. (Ex. Make art for a fic with no comments). Throughout January, you can make as few or as many pieces of art as you like - you can aim for a bingo, a blackout, or just pick one fic you really want to make art for. Post your work anywhere you&apos;d normally post it, then share it with the writer and the Fanart Frenzy community.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>Can&apos;t draw?</h4>
</div>
<div>
    <p>No worries! This event is about all kinds of art, not just traditional art - everything from playlists to gif sets to cookies to fiber arts, memes, and more. Anything artistic you can do inspired by a fanfic is perfect for this event.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <p>If you don&apos;t enjoy making art, the event also includes a <strong>Comment Challenge</strong>! During sign up, you can choose a bingo card with only art-related prompts, only commenting-related prompts, or a mix of the two. Non-artists can participate alongside artists by following the prompts to find fics in their fandoms in need of thoughtful, kind comments. (Ex. Leave a comment on a fic you&apos;ve reread.)</p>
