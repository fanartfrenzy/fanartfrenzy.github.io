<h5>Our stance on AI</h5>
<p>
    We’ve gotten some asks about using AI to make stuff for the event and if it will be accepted. The answer is no,
    AI is
    not accepted in any form for Fanart Frenzy.
    <br>
    Fanart Frenzy is an event created to combat scammers that were targeting fanfic writers, many of whom use AI as
    part
    of their tactic. Being anti-AI is baked into this event at its core. AI is theft and we find the use of it to be
    disrespectful to the many wonderful artists and writers that have signed up to participate in this event and
    support
    each other through their creations.
    <br>
    We firmly believe that anything you, a human, can create is better than whatever an AI can put out. Your work is
    valuable because you created it, perceived flaws and all. You don't have to be good at something to create for
    this
    event- it's only going to be meaningful if you create.
    <br>
    We promise that your fellow writers, any writers, will be thrilled to receive any product made by your hand.
    Even if
    you think it’s bad or messy or imperfect. It’s real, and it’s human.
    <br><br>
    All that said, we would like to again reinforce: no, AI is not allowed in this event.
